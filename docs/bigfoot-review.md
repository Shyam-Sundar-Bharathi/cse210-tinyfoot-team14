### 1. Architecture design
The main function is initialized using the Bigfoot  plugin `$.bigfoot()`. Bigfoot.js follows a modular and layered architecture designed to create seamless, responsive footnotes. It is built using CoffeeScript, which compiles to JavaScript. This provides a more concise syntax while still outputting standard JavaScript for compatibility.

Key architectural features include:

**Modularity**: Footnote behavior and styling are managed separately, allowing flexibility and ease of maintenance.
**Dependency Management**: Built around jQuery for efficient DOM manipulation, ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
**CoffeeScript Usage**: CoffeeScript allows for cleaner code by reducing boilerplate JavaScript, improving readability and maintainability.
**Responsive and Accessible**: The design ensures footnotes are accessible (following WCAG standards) and responsive, adjusting fluidly to various screen sizes.
## 2. Code organisation
Bigfoot.js is structured clearly to help developers work with the code efficiently.

CoffeeScript Source Code: The main logic is written in CoffeeScript (.coffee files), which is compiled into standard JavaScript for compatibility across browsers.

Separation of Concerns: There is a clean distinction between the business logic (written in CoffeeScript), styles (handled via CSS), and HTML markup, which improves clarity and maintenance.

Readable Output: Despite using CoffeeScript, the generated JavaScript code is readable and compatible with most environments.
### 3. Pattern, language
Bigfoot.js employs a combination of patterns and languages for effective development:

**Design Patterns**:
 -Module Pattern: Encapsulates functionality, avoiding global scope pollution and making the code more reusable.
 -Factory Pattern: Used for generating footnote elements dynamically.
**Language**:
 -CoffeeScript: A high-level language that compiles into JavaScript, making the code more concise and readable. It is ideal for developers who prefer a cleaner syntax.
 -CSS: Used extensively for the styling of footnotes, ensuring they are easily customizable and responsive.
 -JavaScript ES5: While CoffeeScript is used for development, the compiled output is in standard ES5, ensuring compatibility with older browsers.
### 4. Repository Organization
The repository is structured in a developer-friendly way, making it easier to contribute, track changes, and extend functionality.

**Readme & Documentation**: Clear instructions on setup, usage, and customization are provided in the README. The documentation also covers advanced topics like custom footnotes.

Source Control:

**src**: Contains the source files in CoffeeScript, organized by functionality.
**dist**: Contains compiled JavaScript files and CSS files ready for production.
**docs**: Contains this required bigfoot-review.md documentation.
**Version Control**: Follows semantic versioning to help developers understand the impact of updates and patches.

**Issue Tracker & Contributions**: Open-source development is supported by an active issue tracker and contribution guidelines, allowing external developers to participate in the project.

## 5. Tool quality
The overall quality of the Bigfoot.js tool is reflected in several areas:

**Efficiency**: CoffeeScript allows for less verbose code, making the project easier to extend and maintain. The compiled JavaScript performs efficiently in various browser environments.

**Browser Compatibility**: Bigfoot.js is designed to work across different browsers, including older versions, thanks to the ES5 JavaScript compilation.

**Customization**: It is highly customizable, allowing developers to tailor the footnote appearance and behavior to their needs.

### 6. Advantages, Disadvantages
1. **Advantages**: 
    1. Simple to integrate into existing projects with minimal setup required.
    2. Offers various configuration options and styles, allowing developers to tailor footnotes to their needs.
    3. Built-in features that improve the accessibility of footnotes, making them usable for all users.
    4. Adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
2. **Disadvantages**:
    1. Requires jQuery, which may not be desirable in projects aiming for minimal dependencies or those using modern frameworks.
    2. Limited Documentation, more comprehensive examples and use cases could enhance usability, especially for complex scenarios.
