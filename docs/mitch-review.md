# Review Doc for bigfoot.js

### Architecture Design

Bigfoot.js is designed as a jQuery plugin that enhances HTML footnotes. The architecture follows a modular approach within a **single file**:

1. **Plugin Initialization**: The main function `$.bigfoot()` is called to initialize the plugin.
2. **Settings**: A comprehensive set of settings allows user to customize the plugin.
3. **Core Functionality**: Functions like `createPopover`, `removePopovers`, and `repositionFeet` form the backbone of the plugin's functionality.
4. **Event Handling**: Functions like `buttonHover` and `touchClick` manage user interactions.
5. **Utility Functions**: Smaller helper functions are scattered throughout the file.

### Code Organization

The code is primarily contained within a single CoffeeScript file (bigfoot.coffee). While this approach keeps everything in one place, it may hinder maintainability for larger codebases.

### Repository Organization

The repository structure is straightforward but could be improved:

Pros:
- Clear separation of source and distribution files.
- Includes both minified and non-minified versions of the JS file.

Cons:
- No clear structure for tests or examples.
- Lack of a dedicated documentation folder.
- No technical documents including dev setup, etc.

### Tool Quality

The project uses Grunt as its build tool, which was popular at the time but has since been largely replaced by more modern tools. The Gruntfile.coffee configures several tasks:


### Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:
1. Easy to use.
2. Highly customizable through a wide range of options.
3. Handles complex footnote scenarios and positioning.

Disadvantages:
1. No apparent test suite, making it difficult to ensure reliability across changes.
2. All functionality in a single file, which could hinder maintainability.
3. JavaScript generated with CoffeeScript different than the original source

Overall, this is a simple tool to enhance the functionality of footnotes in HTML. The project structure is fairly simple, easy to understand. However, the code of the tool itself is a bit of a smell. First of all, the code is poor-structured, there is no modularization in this project, making it very hard to read. Even more difficult to debug or trackdown a specific functionality. In addition, the code has no test converage, which makes code changes at a higher risks. We would never know when we step on a footgun, changes might easily break the entire functionality. To develop or build something on top of this requires an overall understanding of the codebase, as well as multiple refactors. The effort doing so might just be as time-consuming as building a new footnote tool from scratch.
