# Warm-Up Retrospective

**Date:** 10/20/2024, 4:00 PM  
**Project Name:** Refactoring Bigfoot Library to purely JavaScript ES6-based Tinyfoot

---

## 1. What Went Well

### Achievements
- Thoroughly reviewed the Bigfoot and Littlefoot libraries, including their design, structure, and the improvements required for a successful refactor.
- Successfully identified the differences between jQuery and JavaScript, focusing on transitioning features from jQuery-based to native JavaScript, ensuring a cleaner and more modern implementation.
- Eliminated the original dependency on JavaScript libraries like jQuery, allowing for cleaner integration, better performance, and a more modular codebase.
- Refactored the Bigfoot library into JavaScript, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

### Team Dynamics
- Team members demonstrated excellent collaboration during the early phases of the project, especially in understanding and dissecting the existing code, which laid the groundwork for a smoother refactoring process.
- Despite short notice for some meetings, the team remained highly motivated, with most members attending even if meetings were scheduled just a few hours prior.
- Open and constructive discussions around dependency removal allowed for multiple perspectives, resulting in over 8 ideas and 5 formal ADRs, showcasing the team's analytical and creative problem-solving abilities.

### Tools & Processes
- The use of version control, combined with frequent and thorough code reviews, ensured that all team members could contribute meaningfully and that code quality remained high.
- The team effectively used issues and branches to manage the repository, ensuring that work was clearly separated into independent branches. This modular approach facilitated parallel work streams and avoided integration issues.
- Even those team members with little experience in repository management quickly adapted and became proficient, contributing to a well-managed and organized codebase by the end of the warm-up phase.

## 2. Challenges Faced

### Technical Challenges
- Refactoring an outdated language base posed significant challenges, especially when transitioning the Bigfoot library from jQuery to modern JavaScript. This required substantial effort in understanding legacy patterns and rethinking them using modern practices.
- Complex portions of the library required different designs than those used originally, as JavaScript and jQuery handle DOM manipulation and asynchronous logic differently.
- The removal of the original JavaScript dependency introduced some unexpected technical roadblocks, delaying certain aspects of the refactoring and requiring additional research and rework.

### Team Communication
- Some team members struggled initially with aligning the overall structure and design of the refactored code, leading to occasional misunderstandings during implementation.
- Varied levels of JavaScript experience within the team resulted in differing development speeds, as less experienced members required more time to familiarize themselves with the language and coding patterns.
- Frequent changes in meeting plans, particularly around offline meetings, made it difficult for everyone to attend simultaneously, resulting in information discrepancies and a lack of continuity for some team members.

### Time Management
- The team faced tight deadlines, which, combined with other academic commitments, put significant pressure on the group. This was particularly evident toward the end of the warm-up phase, where balancing coursework and refactoring work became challenging.
- Lack of documentation: less structured documentation available online for Bigfoot and Littlefoot.

## 3. Team Analysis

### A. Individual Contributions

#### Strengths
- Several team members demonstrated expertise in multiple areas, including GitHub management, repository structuring, and JavaScript, helping guide the rest of the team through the refactoring process.
- Team members stepped up and offered to help where needed, which helped to get the project going.
- Everyone attended class, which showed commitment to this class and to each other.

#### Weaknesses
- Some team members lacked sufficient experience in web development, particularly with JavaScript, which resulted in a slower learning curve and impacted their ability to contribute effectively in the early stages.
- Conflicting schedules made it difficult for all members to attend meetings simultaneously.
- GitHub issues: due to the division of tasks that were overlapping, there was a lot of rebase and conflict resolution while committing changes.

### B. Team Operations

#### Strengths
- The team consistently maintained a regular meeting schedule and utilized collaborative tools like Google Docs and Mattermost for real-time communication, decision tracking, and documentation.
- Decisions were made collaboratively, ensuring balanced ownership of tasks while keeping the team aligned on overall goals.
- Pair programming was leveraged, and setting general due dates helped maintain steady progress.

#### Weaknesses
- There was occasional ambiguity regarding ownership of specific refactoring tasks, which led to duplication of efforts or delays when roles were unclear.
- Disparity in skill sets made it difficult for everyone to contribute to the technical parts of the project.
- The team could have benefited from more structured documentation of decisions made during discussions, reducing follow-up confusion.

### C. Moving Forward

#### What Should Be Done:
- Assign clear ownership for specific parts of the codebase to ensure accountability and reduce the risk of duplicated work.
- Provide additional resources and workshops on JavaScript for team members with less experience to help them contribute equally in the future.
- Improve documentation processes for team decisions and meetings so that everyone is aligned, even when certain members cannot attend.

## 4. Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
- Refactoring large, complex libraries like Bigfoot requires deep knowledge of the original codebase and the target language (JavaScript).
- Learning to analyze and restructure an unfamiliar repository effectively is a valuable skill.
- This project was an excellent opportunity for the team to get a headstart in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, given their background.

### Team Collaboration
- Regular check-ins and collaborative discussions were essential, though more structured task assignments could have prevented task overlaps.
- Rescheduling meetings could have been avoided by sharing detailed minutes to minimize disruption.
- The team enjoyed the experience and had fun, learning about each other's cultures and habits.

### Process Improvements
- Setting clearer milestones and assigning concrete task owners at the start would have helped manage time and resources more efficiently.

## 5. Action Items for Improvement

### Immediate Actions
- Allocate time for team-based learning sessions and independent projects for those less familiar with JavaScript.
- Improve the documentation process for ongoing tasks and decision-making, ensuring detailed meeting notes are available.
- Encourage members to take on smaller independent projects over weekends to solidify their understanding of key concepts.

### Long-Term Changes
- Implement pair programming or mentoring sessions to help less experienced team members build their skills in future project phases.
- Define clearer task ownership and establish a process for monitoring progress to avoid bottlenecks.

## 6. Closing Thoughts

### Final Reflections
- Despite the challenges, the team made significant progress during the warm-up phase, gaining valuable experience in refactoring, team collaboration, repository management, and modern JavaScript.

### What's Next?
- The next steps involve solidifying the teamâ€™s understanding of the refactored code and optimizing the workflow for the upcoming phases of the project. Addressing the challenges and implementing the suggested improvements will set the team up for continued success.
